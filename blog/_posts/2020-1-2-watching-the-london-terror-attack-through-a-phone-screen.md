I find out first from my phone. That’s how it is these days: a notification, a buzz and a red circle in the corner of an app. My pocket vibrates, and when I check it, there is a message from a friend, panicked.

“I hope you’re okay. Let me know you’re safe!”

I can deduce from the message that something is happening, but I have no idea what. Gas leak, train crash, terrorism, Black Friday-related atrocity, I don’t know.

> It’s as if we’re joining everything in medias res, like a postmodern film.

It is a peculiar ailment of the modern world to know that something is happening, but to not know what. I often find myself on Twitter seeing outrage but not knowing what I should be outraged at. It’s as if we’re joining everything in medias res, like a postmodern film.

“I’m fine,” I text back, “but out of the loop. Something has happened?”

I am on a tube train, so the signal is patchy. Underground there is no phone connectivity, but each station has Wi-Fi. As you travel beneath London you catch glimpses of what’s happening on the surface in the 30 seconds at each stop between your phone connecting to the wireless and the tube departing.

I google London Bridge. A flurry of news sites appear across the top of the page. Google’s algorithms have worked out that something is going on, and rather than display a map and the Wikipedia page about the bridge, Google displays the news headlines. The results are in a different layout for a different event: Crises play out through the CSS files that style them. The news sites, similarly, have switched to an alternative layout — a live, updating, more-exciting “incident” page. “Latest updates” they say, each chunk of text time stamped, the page auto-updating with tweets, images, and quotes.

I’m a techie sort, so I find myself viewing catastrophes through the lens of the technology around them. These websites are the result of software engineers, designers, and product managers, sitting down and creating them, in preparation for disasters and events. Somewhere, a developer wrote the JavaScript logic for this page, knowing that one day something bad would happen that would require this code to be deployed, yet not knowing what that catastrophe would be.

Updates from above the ground bombard me in the windows of signal I get:
“London Bridge is on lockdown after shots fired,” my friend says. “Lots of sirens and helicopters.”

On Twitter, and on the news sites, The Guardian, the BBC, and others, updates pop in piecemeal. Tweets from people on the scene embedded.

Members of the NRA tweet: “If Britain allowed guns this wouldn’t have happened,” exploiting the news for their cause. “Yeah, I’m probably not going to take advice from a country with constant mass shootings,” someone tweets, in reply. This exchange is repeated, over and over again, with various degrees of profanity and understatement. It is not clear yet that the shooting was done by a police officer — the only people legally allowed to carry guns in Britain.

On the tube, some people know something is going on and are on their phones, snatching the same few precious moments of Wi-Fi to check alternate routes, and text friends. Others continue their commute, unaware, playing games on their phones that involve popping bubbles or moving blocks. Everyone is on their phones, whether they know about the incident or not. On the Northern Line an announcement explains that London Bridge station is closed due to an incident. Also the district line is running slowly due to signaling problems.

A different friend texts me. “Are you at London Bridge? I hope you haven’t been shot.” And then he sends a link to an unrelated article about technology that he thinks I might be interested in. “This makes some good points,” he says. I guess he had the link already in his paste buffer and didn’t want to lose it just because of a nutter at London Bridge. Britain carries on in the face of adversity, as they say. Even if that carrying on is sharing links over social media. Stuck on the train, there’s not much for me to do, so I read the article. He’s right, it did make some good points.

I get off at Borough, the next station along from London Bridge. The crowds are building up and the lifts are full. People are queuing down to the platform. I take the stairs. A sign at the bottom says: “Warning: there are 104 stairs, use only in an emergency.”

Perhaps this is an emergency. Perhaps I don’t like queuing for lifts. Or perhaps it is good exercise. I guess it can be all three. When we reach the top, behind me I hear a woman saying to her husband, “I’ve never been up so many stairs in my life.” It is like they too have been through the ordeal. Perhaps they will tweet about it.

Above ground, there are crowds. Police cars are parked haphazardly across roads. A helicopter circles overhead, its engine noise echoing off the buildings. Seemingly every hand is holding a phone. A forest of iPhones and Samsungs, the camera apps open. Some people are taking photos of the helicopter. One man, a tourist, is taking a picture of the Shard, London’s tallest building, seemingly oblivious to the excitement. Perhaps he thinks London is always like this.

There’s a strange holiday-feel to London Bridge. Like a festival, or Mardi Gras. The road has been closed to traffic, and people are walking in the middle of the street, ambling quite aimlessly. By the time I get there, the threat has been resolved. We don’t know what is happening, but we know the danger has gone. It’s replaced by the hope of seeing something exciting. And, perhaps more importantly, capturing that exciting thing on camera. The phones are pointing all over the place, at the ready, in case of drama.

I reach a police cordon, blocking the way to my destination. There are a few journalists, some shoulder-mounted broadcast cameras, but orders of magnitude more amateurs with camera phones. As I’m pondering whether to try a different route or whether to abandon the meeting I’m trying to get to, there is a screaming of police sirens. The police lift the cordon, and six police cars and a fire engine drive past. The crowd, as one, train their cameras on them, the news camera crews try to get a nicely framed shot that can perhaps be part of a package on the 6 o’clock news this evening.

> The footage is retweeted faster than it can be deleted.

I wonder what everyone will do with their videos of six police cars driving past. They’re a sort of proof, I suppose: I was there. Will they show these videos to their friends, like holiday photos? Or will they post them to Twitter and Facebook, becoming part of the global narrative, small fragments that can be pieced together to tell the whole story? Maybe the recordings will sit on their phones and in the Photos and iCloud servers of Google and Apple and never be watched by a human again. Perhaps they’ll only ever be seen by A.I.s, using them as learning sets to identify what a police car is, and the odd zero-hours third-party contractor to verify the A.I. was correct. For the people that took these videos, perhaps knowing they caught the moment is all that matters.

In front of me, a man is getting shirty with a Police Community Support Officer. “My wife is over there,” he points across the cordoned off area to another street. “How am I going to get to her?”

“You’re not,” the PCSO says, “you’re going to wait here, and she’s going to wait there.” The man is bristling and I wonder if another incident is about to kick off. Incidents beget incidents. The primary danger is over, but the new danger is what do about the thousands of people milling around aimlessly with their cameras out who are quite possibly going to cause accidents through their sheer numbers.

Behind me, two women are stressing about how they’re going to get home. “Borough station is open,” I say, “but it’ll be very busy.”

They want directions so I tell them how to get there. They thank me, more effusively than is strictly necessary. The usual rules of not talking to strangers in the street have broken down. We’re all in this together — where “this” is feeling a vague sense of adrenaline and having to navigate an overcrowded public transport system.

I walk back down the street, and I notice that the pubs are full. People are spilling out of the doors, pints in their hands. It is 3:30 on a Friday afternoon, an hour and 20 minutes after armed police arrived on the scene. The incident has led to workplaces being evacuated, but after a while, the evacuated workers have given up trying to catch a video of anything exciting and they’ve retired to the pubs, cheering and shouting like children that have been let out of school early. There is only so much you can say about something happening on London Bridge, so it’s not long before their conversations inevitably become normal pub chatter, the incident put to one side.

Information comes in dribs and drabs. We find out that [two people were killed by a man with a knife](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50594810). Three others were injured before [members of the public](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/queen-leads-tributes-to-brave-heroes-in-london-bridge-attack/2019/11/30/01438696-1372-11ea-b0fc-62cc38411ebb_story.html) wrestled him to the floor, one armed with a five-foot narwhal tusk, another with a fire extinguisher. Sometimes I wonder if the world is getting more surreal. The attacker was wearing a vest designed to look like it contained a bomb, and while he was lying defenseless on the ground, with members of the public on all sides, armed police make the call to shoot to kill.

> Phone videos from the scene become a choose your own adventure of political spin.

With people on all sides, and a camera in every hand and every pocket, the moment itself is captured, not just once, not just twice, but thousands of times from every angle. All in luxurious HD, HDR, maybe even 4K, machine learning balancing the color to make it as clear as possible, and then backing it up to the cloud to keep it safe forever or until the user runs out of storage space. The Ofcom-regulated broadcasters and newspapers do not show the footage, even though they have it, of course. But on Twitter, the footage flies around. Horrible people retweet it with horrible comments and the outspoken shout back. When enough people press the “report this content” button, Twitter slowly takes some tweets down, but the footage is retweeted faster than it can be deleted.

The incident is, of course, shocking and horrific. For the families of the victims, it is an awful day, for which no one can offer solace. A random senseless incident that singled out those particular people above all others. But the rest of us view it through our screens. A piece of media, that rapidly becomes adapted to our worldview. It is used as an opportunity to advocate for gun rights, to discuss harsher sentences for criminals, or for more funding for the justice department. It becomes a choose your own adventure of political spin.

The fake news army move in immediately, inventing a tweet from Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the U.K.’s left-wing political party, criticizing the police. It is so easy to fake tweets — right click, inspect element, delete the real words, type in your fake ones, screenshot, and there you go. The work takes seconds. We are two weeks away from an election in the U.K., so the timing of this event is convenient for the right-wing parties that do better in these situations. My Twitter timeline is filled with conspiracy theories followed by criticisms of such conspiracy theories. You can watch people making sense of the incident in real time on social media.

Another Twitter thread starts with people telling the story of the brave people who wrestled the attacker to the ground. One Twitter user says “That’s the British spirit.” His Twitter icon is a red, white, and blue Union flag and his Twitter bio says: “Get Brexit done, get the immigrants out.”

Later it turns out that the stiff-upper-lip, only-in-Britain hero who grabbed the narwhal horn from the wall and took it into battle is a first-generation [immigrant Polish chef called Łukasz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/30/brexit-backers-stoked-fears-over-polish-workers-pouring-now-one-is-london-bridge-hero/). I notice there are now noticeably fewer calls for him to get a knighthood.

Across the web, we get an insight into the allowed character sets of news agencies’ CMSs. Some are able to support the special Ł character in his name. Others can’t handle it, and style his name Lukasz. It tends to be the more liberal news agencies that can present his name properly, I notice. Xenophobia played out through website character encoding.

I find a coffee shop and sit down. There is only so much responding you can do to a situation like this, so after a bit I catch up on my emails, as life, for those of us not personally affected, continues. The special rolling news web pages will be switched back to the normal template. Coverage of the UK election will continue, only this time, with a requirement for politicians to talk about being tough on terrorism.

I wonder about all those videos, and tweets, and pictures of the event. The blurry photos of a helicopter hovering over head, doing nothing. The shots of bored PCSOs standing by police cordons, their faces smoothed and beautified by A.I. machine learning in the cameras. I feel a sense of conflict about all these consumer features of phones and social media being put towards capturing atrocities. It is not the fault of Apple or Google or Samsung, of course, but it is almost as if the event works hand in hand with the technology available. Everyone has a camera, so now they need something to shoot with it. Perhaps crowds are naturally voyeuristic, but would everyone be so desperate to see some drama if they didn’t have in their pocket a 12MP camera and a ready audience on social media?

Of course, I am being hypocritical. Adding to that with these very words. Or perhaps it was remiss of me not to capture, with my camera, the crowds gathering, the police cordoning and the technology recording.

Technology shapes us and affects our actions, and now even plays a role in our sense-making of events. For some people, the killer will have been radicalized through Twitter, Reddit, or the so-called dark web. For others, his violence will be as a result of video games, or maybe violent television, streamed through online video services.

There was a time, not even that long ago, when, in the face of a catastrophe happening before them, people would put down their technology. The television would be turned off, the computer shut down. Work would stop. But now, the phones come out, Twitter comes up, and in the offices of technology companies around the world, specially prepared sites are deployed.

Even on Google Maps, a new icon appears on London Bridge, with a caption beside it: London Bridge violence. Someone, at some point, picked that icon, chose the size of the fade around it, and picked the shade of the font color in preparation for a moment like this. And I can’t help wondering: Is that warning there to warn people to stay away or to point people to what to aim their cameras at? Or perhaps it’s not that at all. Perhaps, like the photos of helicopters and cordons, it’s just to say: We are part of this.
